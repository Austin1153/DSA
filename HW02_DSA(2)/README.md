# Program Homework 2 DSA(2)

1. generate random undirected graph (50%)
  * User Interface for 2 int input
    * `n`, number of nodes
    * `e`, number of edges ($e \leq C^n_2$)
  * edges generate using random assign
  * display as both adjacent matrix and lists
  * also display it using NodeXL

2. Go through DFS & BFS traversal according to graph above (50%)
  * result should be 2 trees (DFS tree & BFS tree)
  * also display as both adjacent matrix and lists
  * also display DFS tree & BFS tree using NodeXL
