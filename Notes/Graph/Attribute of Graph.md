* A [[graph]] with **n** vertices have $C^n_2$ distinct unordered pair
  distinct unordered pair : $(u, v)$ where $u \neq v$ 
* for directed graph, is $n(n-1)$ ($2C^n_2$)
### Complete graph
An **n**-vertex, **undirected** graph with exactly $C^n_2$ edges 
### Adjacent
* undirected graph
  $(u,v)$ : $u$ and $v$ v are adjacent 
  the edge $(u, v)$ is incident on $u$ and $v$
* diagraph
  $<u,v>$ : $u$ is adjacent **to** $v$, $v$ is adjacent **from** $u$
  the edge $<u, v>$ is incident on $u$ and $v$
