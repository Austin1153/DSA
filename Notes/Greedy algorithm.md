* Each step of a greedy algorithm must make one of several possible choices.
從可能的選擇當中選擇一種
* The greedy strategy advocates making the choice that is the best at the moment.
策略就是選的那種會是當下最佳的
* Such a strategy does not generally guarantee that it will always find globally optimal solutions to problem.
不過不能保證當下最佳的就是整體來說最好的解決方案
