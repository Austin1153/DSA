## Binary insertion sort
**Replace the sequential search by binary search** in the Insert Func. The number of records moves remains the same.
* Insertion: sequential search -> binary search
### List insertion sort
Using **linked list**,the number of **record moves becomes 0** because only the link fields require adjustment.
* However, we must **retain the sequential search.**
